<h2>Better viz</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.swac.umn.edu/sites/swac.umn.edu/files/cates_public_cv.pdf">Anna Cates</a>, a blog reader and soil ecologist working at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had a great suggestion for visualizing market-share change over time for different varietals - the stacked bar chart! I thought I’d write a brief post with some code!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)


#importing the master data set we&#39;ve been working with
bean_master_import = read_csv(file = &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keatonwilson/beans/master/data/bean_master_joined.csv&quot;)



bean_master_import_bar = bean_master_import %&gt;%
  mutate(month = month(date),
         class = factor(class)) %&gt;%
  group_by(year, month, class) %&gt;%
  summarize(monthly_mean_market_share = mean(class_market_share)) 

#Making a new column of just the beginning of each month, since we&#39;re binning by month
beg_month_date = paste(bean_master_import_bar$year, bean_master_import_bar$month, rep(1, length(bean_master_import_bar$year)), sep = &quot;-&quot;)

bean_master_import_bar$beg_month_date = ymd(beg_month_date)

#Filtering to get rid of some of the noise
bean_master_import_bar %&gt;%
  filter(monthly_mean_market_share &lt; 0.25) %&gt;%

ggplot( aes(x = beg_month_date, y = monthly_mean_market_share, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;fill&quot;, width = 200) +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab(&quot;Percentage Market Share&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;Date&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Nice! This is a much more informative way to view the data - we can easily see trends over time more clearly than with the loess-smoothed trends in the previous post.</p>
<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We have some gaps in our data at 1992 - I’ll need to go back and look at the original data frame to see what is going on there.<br />
</li>
<li>I’ve manually set the width parameter here so there is some overlap in bars - this helps smooth out the graph - overall, trends are the same, and easier to read/visualize when there isn’t jitter or small white gaps.<br />
</li>
<li>One way around these issues might be to bin in larger time-chunks - perhaps every 3 months instead of every month - I didn’t do that here, but it would be a nice challenge!</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
