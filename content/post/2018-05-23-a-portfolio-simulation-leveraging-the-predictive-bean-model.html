  Here, I show a demonstration of a simple investing/selling simulation based on historic bean data and the Random Forest model we built two posts ago. The basic premise is to see how much money we could make if we had had access to the predictive model in the 80s to 2011, and had purchased and sold beans based on the predictions it makes.

<h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>It’s been a while! Sorry for the delay on posting, but things have been a bit crazy with the transition between the end of the semester at UA and moving into Summer research projects! I’ve also become a little obsessed with the Tidy Tuesday challenge on Twitter - it’s a cool project for the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23r4ds">#r4ds</a> (R for Data Science) community that sends out weekly datasets that Twitterfolks can munge and visualize with the fantastic tidyverse packages. If you’re interested, you can check out <a href="www.twitter.com/keatonwilson">my submissions on Twitter</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday repo on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Enough of a preamble. Where were we? Oh right. Beans.</p>

<h2>What happens if we had our bean model to make investments in real life?</h2>
<p>This post comes out of discussion with friends and family after building the predictive bean model - what sort of real world application does this have? Sure, it seems like a reasonable financially beneficial thing to be able to predict markets with a high degree of accuracy, but what does that actually mean to someone interested in throwing some money at buying and selling dry beans?</p>
<p>Well, I thought it might be useful to try and simulate an investment scenario. The rules are fairly simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>You start with $10k to invest<br />
</li>
<li>You can’t spend more than 33% of your capital on a given week<br />
</li>
<li>Of that 33%, you spend as much as you can if the model predicts that the price will be higher in 6 months than the current price, otherwise you don’t buy anything<br />
</li>
<li>You sell all of those beans 6 months down the line at whatever the market price is<br />
</li>
<li>You can’t spend more than 100k on one purchase (optimistic that you’ll have this much bank eventually)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s build the simulation (it’s also worth noting here that we’re preforming this simulation on the out-of-sample test data).</p>

<p>The output of this chunk of code above is what we’re going to work with - specifically, the test set - which means that the simulation we’ll run will be completely on out-of-sample data, which should provide a more realistic set of predictions.</p>
<p>We need to do a few things before we get into the nitty-gritty of building the model though: first, we need to get rid of duplicate rows - which simplifies our simulation a lot. Instead of making decisions among all of the varietals for a given week that might give the best return on investment, we’re going to set up a simple scenario where we only look at weeks where there is one option - and then decide whether to buy or not. This next code chunk also a few other details - we’ve loaded our previously-built model as an RDS object, and then use it to bind predictions back onto the data frame.</p>

<p>Whoa! So if we had conservatively purchased based on the rules of this simulation and had our predictive model in hand since the 80s, we could have turned our $10k into 150,000,000. Not too bad. We can also look and see how many times our model steered us wrong and we lost money.</p>

<p>Yikes, some heavy losses, particularly in the 90s and early 00s, with the biggest of $325k in March of 2010 - but, when you’ve got 153 million in the bank, it’s not as drastic as it seems.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Hopefully this was an interesting example of the power of leveraging the ML model to predict real-world data. The simulation clearly illustrates the predictive power of the model, but also has a few built-in assumptions that are worth mentioning:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We aren’t making choices among varietals each week (i.e. do I buy pintos or garbanzos, even when the model predicts both will turn a profit) like a real broker would. I initially went down the road to try and simulate this, but got stuck in the code - something I’d like to revisit some day soon.<br />
</li>
<li>One <strong>BIG</strong> assumption is that you’re able to sell all of the beans you buy. It may not always be so easy to totally liquidate all of your beans at a certain price.</li>
<li>There aren’t any costs associated with holding beans here - in the real world, you’d have to warehouse them, and transport them somewhere, all which come at a price.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless, an impressive display of prediction!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
