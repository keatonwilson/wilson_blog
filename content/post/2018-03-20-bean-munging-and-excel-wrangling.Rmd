## Messy Excel Files  

So, as I discussed last time, the first big hurdle in starting to explore the domestic dry bean market data was overcoming
the terror of working with a bunch of really messy, really gnarly excel files. 

The main one looks like this:![](/img/beans1.png)  

Lots of problems, right? The data are in multiple sheets in a single workbook, they're not uniform, etc. It's an R-user's nightmare, but the reality is that data often look like this. So let's get to work. 

A brief point - here is the type of data we can expect from this workbook:  

* year  
* month  
* day  
* class (type of bean or variety)  
* price  
 
### Step 1. Reading in the data  

First things first, let's load up some useful packages  

```{r message = FALSE} 
library(tidyverse) 
library(readxl)
library(rJava)
library(XLConnect)
```

We'll use the handy functions in readxl and XLConnect to read in the the excel sheets and then use tidyverse to do a bunch of stuff to them to clean them up. 

All files can be found at my github repo for [this project](https://github.com/keatonwilson/beans/tree/master/data).  

Download the appropriate files to your local working directory - and you're ready to go. 

Let's read in the data with readxl's loadWorkbook function (if you were better at making the RCurl package work than I am, you could pull it directly from my GitHub too):
```{r tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#Loading Workbooks
dealer_price = loadWorkbook(file = 
                      "/Users/KeatonWilson/Documents/Projects/beans2/data/Weekly_Dealer_price.xls") 
#Remember your directory will be different

#Turning workbook into a list
dealer_price_list = readWorksheet(dealer_price, sheet = getSheets(dealer_price))

#Lots of errors with this, but don't worry. 

#Looks good...lots of NAs, but there is data in there. 
head(dealer_price_list[[1]], n = 20)
```

Great! Now we have a list of the data from each year (where each item in the list is a dataframe of market data for different types of beans for each year). 

If we look through all the dataframes in our list - there is a bunch of junk at the top of each one we need to get rid of. Let's use the handy `{r} lapply ` function for this. 

``` {r tidy=TRUE}

#Bunch of garbage on the top of every data frame - need to iterate through the list and delete the first 11 rows
dealer_price_list = lapply(dealer_price_list, function(x) x[-c(1:11),])
head(dealer_price_list[[1]], n = 20)
```

Ok, now it gets gnarly.  
Here is the problem - not all data frames have the same variables, and it looks like variable names are hidden somewhere down in each dataframe.  
I ended up going through each data frame manually - obviously this doesn't scale super well - and is laborious, but I couldn't come up with a clever way to automate this, but here is an example of the type of code I used: 

``` {r tidy=TRUE}
#1981
glimpse(dealer_price_list[[1]])
dealer_price_list[[1]]
dealer_price_list[[1]] = dealer_price_list[[1]][-c(64:100),-14]
colnames(dealer_price_list[[1]]) = c("Month", "Day", "Pinto", "Grt_Northern", "Pink", "Sm_Red", "Navy", "B_Lima", "L_Lima", "Blackeye",
                                     "Small_White", "Kidney", "Garbanzo")
glimpse(dealer_price_list[[1]])
```

Look at how nice that looks! Now it's time to iterate through all the dataframes. You may be thinking to yourself, "Hey, why don't you do that with a loop, or with lapply?". That's a great idea... except that dataframes vary in their content. Manual brute-force it is.  

Let's skip ahead a bit - with a bit more munging and cleaning, we end up with a very nice long-format dataframe, that you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keatonwilson/beans/master/data/dealer_price_long.csv).  

Or alternatively:  
```{r}
dealer_price_long = read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keatonwilson/beans/master/data/dealer_price_long.csv")
dealer_price_long 
```

Also note that this is in tibble format now. Thanks, Hadley. :)

### Conclusions

This is a great start. We went from an awful Excel Workbook to a slim and trim tidy dataframe with ~24,000 entries of bean prices from 1981-2010 - this is going to be a big chunk of the data we end up splitting into training and test sets down the road for Machine Learning.  

A small aside - there was a bunch of munging and cleaning involved between some of the steps above. If you're interested in a deeper dive into what was entailed, check out the full [source code](https://github.com/keatonwilson/beans/blob/master/data_organization.R) - it's pretty well annotated and can give you a nice look at things.  

Cheers!
