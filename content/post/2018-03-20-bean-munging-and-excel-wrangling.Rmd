## Messy Excel Files  

So, as I discussed last time, the first big hurdle in starting to explore the domestic dry bean market data was overcoming
the terror of working with a bunch of really messy, really gnarly excel files. 

The main one looks like this:![](/img/beans1.png)  

Lots of problems, right? The data are in multiple sheets in a single workbook, they're not uniform, etc. It's an R-user's nightmare, but the reality is that data often look like this. So let's get to work. 

A brief point - here is the type of data we can expect from this workbook:
*  year
*  month
*  day
*  class (type of bean or variety)
*  price

### Step 1. Reading in the data  

First things first, let's load up some useful packages  

```{r message = FALSE} 
library(tidyverse) 
library(readxl)
library(XLConnect)
```

We'll use the handy functions in readxl and XLConnect to read in the the excel sheets and then use tidyverse to do a bunch of stuff to them to clean them up. 

All files can be found at my github repo for [this project](https://github.com/keatonwilson/beans/tree/master/data).  

Download the appropriate files to your local working directory - and you're ready to go. 

Let's read in the data with readxl's loadWorkbook function (if you were better at making the RCurl package work with you, you could pull it directly from my GitHub too):
```{r tidy=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#Loading Workbooks
dealer_price = loadWorkbook(file = 
                      "/Users/KeatonWilson/Documents/Projects/beans2/data/Weekly_Dealer_price.xls") 
#Remember your directory will be different

#Turning workbook into a list
dealer_price_list = readWorksheet(dealer_price, sheet = getSheets(dealer_price))

#Lots of errors with this, but don't worry. 

#Looks good...lots of NAs, but there is data in there. 
head(dealer_price_list[[1]], n = 20)
```

Great! Now we have a list of the data from each year (where each item in the list is a dataframe of market data for different types of beans for each year). 

If we look through all the dataframes in our list - there is a bunch of junk at the top of each one we need to get rid of. Let's use the handy `{r} lapply ` function for this. 

``` {r tidy=TRUE}

#Bunch of garbage on the top of every data frame - need to iterate through the list and delete the first 11 rows
dealer_price_list = lapply(dealer_price_list, function(x) x[-c(1:11),])
head(dealer_price_list[[1]], n = 20)
```

Ok, now it gets gnarly.  
Here is the problem - not all data frames have the same variables, and it looks like variable names are hidden somewhere down in each dataframe.  
I ended up going throgh each data frame manually - obviously this doesn't scale super well - and is laborious, but I couldn't come up with a clever way to sort this out. Here is an example of the type of code I used: 

``` {r tidy=TRUE}
#1981
glimpse(dealer_price_list[[1]])
dealer_price_list[[1]]
dealer_price_list[[1]] = dealer_price_list[[1]][-c(64:100),-14]
colnames(dealer_price_list[[1]]) = c("Month", "Day", "Pinto", "Grt_Northern", "Pink", "Sm_Red", "Navy", "B_Lima", "L_Lima", "Blackeye",
                                     "Small_White", "Kidney", "Garbanzo")
glimpse(dealer_price_list[[1]])
```

Look at how nice that looks! Now it's time to iterate through all the dataframes. You may be thinking to yourself, "Hey, why don't you do that with a loop, or with lapply?". That's a great idea... except that dataframes vary in their content. Manual brute-force it is.
