<p>Hello! I’m an ecologist and data scientist working at the University of Arizona in Tucson. I’m currently a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute
of Health (NIH), but as that position is coming to a close, am on the job market looking for new projects and challenges.</p>
<p>Throughout my fellowship at the University of Arizona, I’ve become increasingly interested in data science, and have taken the plunge in applying some of the techniques I’ve developed a scientist to outside projects. I decided to start this blog to detail and record some of my experiences with these projects, and document my journey into data science.</p>
<p>If you’re mainly interested in my research as an ecologist (on bugs and immune systems and tasty plants), you can check out my <a href="http://www.keatonwilson.net">main website</a>. Though this blog will have bits and bobs of my science, it’s mostly about data science, side-projects and tools and tricks I’ve used.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy! And please feel free to drop me a line any time if you have questions about code, techniques, or comments!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
